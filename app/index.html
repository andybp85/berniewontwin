            <p class="lead">With his 16 years in the House of Representatives, Bernie Sanders is the longest serving independent member of Congress <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/independent-members-of-congress?inline=file" target="_blank">in American History</a>. He was elected as the mayor of Burlington, VT back in 1981 by only 10 votes. He then stayed on for four terms and was elected to Vermont's only seat in the House of Representatives in 1990. He moved on to the Senate in 2006 where he won re-election two years ago with 71% of the vote. He strongly opposes <a href="http://www.progressive.org/news/2011/10/170238/bernie-sanders-denounces-free-trade-pacts" target="_blank">trade agreements by corporations</a> that ask for US Tax Breaks then immidiately outsource jobs overseas <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file" target="_blank">such as the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement</a>. Even going as far as to expose <a href="http://www.politicususa.com/2012/10/25/bernie-sanders-exposes-18-ceos-trillions-bailouts-evaded-taxes-outsourced-jobs.html" target="_blank">18 CEOs who took trillions in bailouts, evaded their taxes and then outsourced those newly created jobs</a>. He has pushed to <a href="http://www.occupydemocrats.com/bernie-sanders-introduces-bill-to-end-offshore-tax-havens-and-outsourcing-of-jobs/" target="_blank">end off-shore tax havens</a> for corporations that also choose to outsource American jobs. He <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-votes-against-patriot-act-extension" target="_blank"> has been against extending the invasive "Patriot Act"</a> which continues to cost American's their civil liberties daily both domestically and abroad. He vows to <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/president-bernie-sanders-would-dismantle-nsa-spying-20150501" target="_blank">dismantle the equally invasive NSA Spy Network</a> which threatens our freedom of speech and press. He believes anyone who works 40 hours a week <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/dem-primaries/240871-sanders-calls-minimum-wage-a-starvation-wage" target="_blank">doesn't deserve to live in poverty</a>. </p>
        <p class="lead">What about these views isn't inline with the American people? <blockquote>"If you raise the issues that are on the hearts and minds of the American people...if you try and put together a movement which says we got to stand together as a people say...our country belong[s] to all of us and not the billionaire class...that's not raising an issue, that's winning elections".<br/> <i class="pull-right">-Bernie Sanders</i></blockquote></p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">We need change in this country. Not just promises of change from politicians who claim to be "for the people" but are backed by corporate interests whom they owe favors to the moment they get into office. Bernie has already stated he <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/30/politics/bernie-sanders-presidential-run-first-interview/" target="_blank">will not launch a Super PAC and does not want billionaires bankrolling his campaign</a>. This should be inspiring to all Americans. We need a candidate with the integrity to stand as an independent. As an American. Bernie represents us and Bernie Sanders cannot be bought.</p>
            <p class="lead">The great thing is: People are already starting to respond. Bernie Sanders has already <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/01/bernie-sanders-has-a-better-fund-raising-start-than-republican-counterparts/" target="_blank">raised more money than his Republican</a> counterparts, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/05/01/bernie-sanders-raises-1-5-million-in-24-hours-says-his-campaign/" target="_blank">raising $1.5 in just 24 hours</a>. People are inspired by Bernie's honesty, his tenacity and his obvious passion and belief that we can make a difference on our own terms. </p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>A Vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for another 4 to 8 years of corporate sponsored politics. Take one look at the stark comparison between her backers and Bernie's:</p>

            <p class="lead">This will not be easy, but Bernie Sanders is no stranger to an uphill political battle. In what would be his final term as Mayor of Burlington, Bernie won against candidates endorsed by both major political parties. When Bernie announced he was runnig for President, Mayor of Burlington Miro Weinberger stated he would support Hillary Clinton. Not surprising, Weinberger <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/local/2015/02/02/weinberger-goodkind-burlington-mayor-campaign-funds/22772621/" target="_blank">ran on a campaign bankrolled by local contractors and developers</a> making it a war of funds, not of ideas. Somethings never change but our political system does not have to be one of them. <blockquote>"The real question is, can any candidate in this country who represents working families, who is not a billionaire, who is not beholden to big corporations — in this day and age, can that candidate win an election?" <i class="pull-right">- Bernie Sanders (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/30/politics/bernie-sanders-presidential-run-first-interview/" target="_blank">source</a>)</i></blockquote></p>
